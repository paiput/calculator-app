## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) 
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a little bit about css modules. I would say that for a simple project like this one css modules are not necessary and it may would be better to simply use css.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Modules Documentation](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - Official CSS Modules Documentation. It's quite simple.
